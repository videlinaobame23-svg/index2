 * WHAT MEMBER 5 DOES HERE
 * At the collection centre the network comes and goes. The collector must see
 * at once whether deliveries reach the server or stay on the phone. You write
 * checkHealth() here, then the banner that shows it.
 * Groups of 4 have no Member 5: both files stay as they are and nobody is marked on them.
 *
 * Done means: npm run test:health -> 3 pass; StatusBanner has no "TODO M5";
 * on the phone the banner says "Server OK", and "Offline..." after you stop the API.
