WHAT MEMBER 5 DOES
A risk score is only useful if we know how often it is right. You count the
four kinds of result (confusion matrix), compute precision and recall, and
write docs/model_card.md, the one page a manager reads before trusting the
model. Your tests use their own small data, so you can start at once.

Groups of 4 have no Member 5: this file stays as it is and nobody is marked on it.

Done means: python -m pytest tests/test_a5_evaluate.py -v   -> 4 passed,
merged into main through a pull request reviewed by a teammate.
Bonus for the demo: create docs/model_card.md from the real data and push it.
