"""A1 · MEMBER 1 · Load and clean the milk deliveries

Owner (your GitHub username): @
Your mobile task in the swe3409-cat1 repository: M3 (DeliveryList)

WHAT MEMBER 1 DOES
Every morning the collection centre writes each can of milk into
data/deliveries.csv. The file is messy. You make the table the whole team
uses: everyone else's work starts from your two functions.

  1. load_deliveries(): read the CSV, refuse a file with missing columns,
     turn the date text into real dates.
  2. clean_deliveries(): fix the codes and remove the rows nobody can trust.

Done means: python -m pytest tests/test_a1_data.py -v   -> 6 passed,
merged into main through a pull request reviewed by a teammate.
