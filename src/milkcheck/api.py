"""A4 · MEMBER 4 · Serve the data and the model to the phone (FastAPI)

Owner (your GitHub username): @
Your mobile task in the swe3409-cat1 repository: M1 (logic.ts)

WHAT MEMBER 4 DOES
You are the AI integrator. The phone app (swe3409-cat1 repository) calls
your API to check the server, to get the risk of a delivery and to send it.
You USE the work of Members 1, 2 and 3: run  git pull  after they merge.
Start with /health and /deliveries: they need nobody else.

Run the server:       uvicorn milkcheck.api:app --reload --app-dir src
For the phones:       uvicorn milkcheck.api:app --host 0.0.0.0 --app-dir src
Then open:            http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs

Done means: python -m pytest tests/test_a4_api.py -v   -> 6 passed,
merged into main through a pull request reviewed by a teammate.
